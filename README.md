# recursion
Recursion Project - from The Odin Project curriculum.

This project will be practice for solving problems recursively. There are two
problems in this project for which I need to implement a recursive solution.
The problems are the Fibonacci Sequence and Merge Sort. I had been reading
about and practicing recursion in the lesson prior to this project, but this
will be the first time I try my hand at implementing a recursive solution for
merge sort using Ruby, an algorithm whose details I don't entirely remember
anymore.
